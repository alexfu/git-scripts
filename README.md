# Git Scripts
Some useful git scripts that I use on a daily basis.

# Install
Drop these files in a reasonable place (i.e. `~/.git/bin`) and make sure that location is in your `PATH`. Git should automatically pick them up.

# Usage
Anything after `git-` in the file name is the command. For example, to execute `git-peek`, we run

```
[alexfu] git peek
```

Or to execute `git-purge-branches`, we run

```
[alexfu] git purge-branches
```
