# Description:
#   This script creates and checks out a new Git branch that's prefixed with
#   your system username. Itâ€™s designed to help avoid branch naming conflicts
#   in team environments by clearly associating your branches with your name.
#
# Usage:
#   git start <branch-suffix> [<base-branch-or-commit>]
#
#   Example:
#     git start new-feature main
#
#   If your username is "alex", the above command will create and check out:
#     alex/new-feature based on the "main" branch.
